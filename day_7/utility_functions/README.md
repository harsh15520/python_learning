## 1. **What Are Utility Functions?**
Utility functions are small, reusable functions that perform general-purpose tasks (like string manipulation, math operations, or data cleaning). They are designed to be used across different parts of your codebase, promoting code reuse and modularity.

## 2. **Where Should You Define Utility Functions?**
- **Standalone Functions in a Module:**
  - The most Pythonic and common approach is to define utility functions as plain functions in a separate `.py` file (module), such as `utils.py` or `helpers.py`.
  - Example:
    ```python
    # utils.py
    def sum_of_list(numbers):
        return sum(numbers)
    ```
  - You can then import and use them anywhere:
    ```python
    from utils import sum_of_list
    print(sum_of_list([1, 2, 3]))
    ```
- **Static Methods in a Class:**
  - If you want to group related utilities together, you can use a class with `@staticmethod` decorators.
  - This is useful for logical grouping, namespacing, or if you plan to extend/override them via subclassing.
  - Example:
    ```python
    class MathUtils:
        @staticmethod
        def sum_of_list(numbers):
            return sum(numbers)
    # Usage:
    print(MathUtils.sum_of_list([1, 2, 3]))
    ```
  - **Note:** If your functions don't need to access or modify class or instance state, static methods are fine. But if you don't need a class, just use plain functions.

## 3. **Best Practices for Utility Functions**
- **Clear, descriptive names:** Make it obvious what the function does.
- **Type hints:** Use type hints for parameters and return values for clarity and better tooling support.
- **Docstrings:** Always include a docstring describing the function's purpose, parameters, and return value.
- **Error handling:** Validate inputs and raise exceptions for invalid data.
- **Keep them focused:** Each function should do one thing well (single responsibility principle).
- **Testability:** Write unit tests for your utility functions to ensure reliability.

## 4. **When to Use Static Methods or Classes?**
- Use a class with static methods if you want to group related utilities, provide a namespace, or allow for subclassing/extension.
- If your utilities are unrelated or don't benefit from grouping, keep them as standalone functions in a module.
- Avoid using a class just for the sake of itâ€”if you don't need class features, plain functions are simpler and more Pythonic.

## 5. **Summary Table**
| Approach                | When to Use                                      |
|------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| Standalone functions   | Most cases; simple, reusable, no class needed    |
| Static methods in class| Grouping, namespacing, or planned subclassing    |
| Class/instance methods | When you need to access/modify class or instance |
