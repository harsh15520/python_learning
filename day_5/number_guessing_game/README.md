This Python game implements a console-based "Number Guess" where a user chooses difficulty (easy, medium, hard) and tries to guess a randomly selected number within a fixed number of attempts. The code is well-structured and logically sound for the intended purpose.

### Key Features and Explanation

- The `get_settings_for_difficulty` function converts the player's chosen difficulty into settings for the guessing range and "closeness" feedback.
- The range is always 0–50, but the threshold for "Very close" feedback tightens as difficulty increases:
  - **Easy:** threshold is 10  
  - **Medium:** threshold is 5  
  - **Hard:** threshold is 2
- `play_round` manages user guesses, gives immediate feedback ("Very close," "Very high," "Very low") and recognizes a correct guess with a win declaration.
- The game loop allows multiple rounds, preserves attempts, and tallies score across rounds, ending when attempts run out or user quits.
- Input validation is included—non-integer guesses prompt users again, and typing 'q' lets players quit early.

### Potential Improvements

- **Random number range:** Allow difficulty to affect both closeness threshold *and* the range (e.g., easy: 0–20, medium: 0–50, hard: 0–100).
- **Type error:** Currently, only integer guesses are accepted, so inputs like '10.0' or negative numbers are ignored.
- **Multiple rounds** are handled well, but feedback for the correct number at round's end could be improved for clarity.
- Implementing user statistics, different scoring systems, or time limits could make the game even more engaging.

### How It Works

1. Start the game and get 10 attempts in total.
2. Pick a round difficulty ("easy", "medium", "hard").
3. Guess a number for that round. If you guess right, you win the round and score goes up.
4. Feedback tells if the guess is close, very high, or very low.
5. Rounds continue until out of attempts or quitting.
6. Final score is displayed.

This code is good for beginners and can be extended for advanced features such as graphical interfaces or variable ranges for added challenge.
